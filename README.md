# Aleatory Time Capture

Aleatory Time Capture is a consumer-facing reality-capture project for preserving meaningful people, places, objects, and moments as explorable spatial memories.

The project is currently in its experimental v0 phase. The launch product line, **Remembering Presence**, is beginning with a small Founding Captures program in Connecticut. The website is an Astro-based, static-first experience with a configurable application form.

## Start here

- Read [`PROJECT_BRIEF.md`](PROJECT_BRIEF.md) for the authoritative vision.
- Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before contributing or assigning agent work.
- Use [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) to find current product, brand, website, technical, and collaboration context.
- Consult [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/) for accepted technical and product decisions.
- Store curated external source material according to [`references/README.md`](references/README.md).

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Other useful checks:

```sh
npm run check
npm run format:check
npm run build
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `PUBLIC_APPLICATION_FORM_ENDPOINT` to an approved HTTPS form endpoint before accepting applications. With no endpoint configured, the application is deliberately displayed in preview mode and cannot submit customer data.

Production uses `https://forms.rememberingpresence.com/apply`, supplied by the GitHub Pages workflow. The endpoint is implemented as a Cloudflare Worker in `worker/`; see [`docs/technical/deployment.md`](docs/technical/deployment.md) for setup and deployment.

The stack decision is recorded in ADR 0001 and the deployment decision in ADR 0002.
